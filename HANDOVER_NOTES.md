# Handover Notes: OpenRouter Integration & CLI Enhancements

**Date:** 2025-03-31

Important: make sure to follow .gitignore and skip reading anything that is not in git. 

## 1. Project Overview

*   **Project:** `llm-tester`
*   **Purpose:** A framework for testing and evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) from various providers against defined test cases and Pydantic models.
*   **Setup:**
    *   Everything is already setup and you are running in venv, so all commands should run without fail. Also all .evn values are in place.

## 2. Task Objectives

The primary goals of this work session were:

1.  Implement support for OpenRouter as a new LLM provider.
2.  Plan and implement related Command Line Interface (CLI) enhancements for better usability (key management, model updates, provider/model selection).
3.  Add integration tests to verify live API calls for providers.

## 3. Current Status & Work Completed

*   **OpenRouter Provider:**
    *   Created directory structure: `llm_tester/llms/openrouter/`.
    *   Created basic provider implementation: `llm_tester/llms/openrouter/provider.py`. Uses the `openai` library configured for the OpenRouter endpoint. Includes recommended headers.
    *   Created configuration file: `llm_tester/llms/openrouter/config.json`. Includes `google/gemini-pro-1.5` and the free `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free` models as examples.
    *   Ensured provider discovery by adding `from .provider import OpenRouterProvider` to `llm_tester/llms/openrouter/__init__.py`.
*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   Created unit tests for `OpenRouterProvider`: `tests/test_openrouter_provider.py`. These tests use mocking and verify initialization and basic call logic. All unit tests are passing.
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   Created a minimal test case: `llm_tester/models/integration_test/` (includes source, prompt, expected files, and `model.py`).
    *   Created a general integration test file: `tests/test_provider_integration.py`.
    *   Configured `tests/conftest.py` to add a `--run-integration` flag to control execution of tests marked with `@pytest.mark.integration`.
    *   The integration test (`test_provider_live_api_call`) is parametrized to run for all discovered providers (excluding `mock`, `pydantic_ai`, and external providers).
    *   It uses predefined cheap/fast models for testing (defined in `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODELS` dictionary within the test file).
    *   Verified that the integration test passes for `openrouter`, `anthropic`, and `openai` providers (assuming valid API keys are present in `llm_tester/.env`).
*   **Environment Loading:**
    *   Corrected `.env` file loading logic in `llm_tester/cli.py` to load `llm_tester/.env` at module level.
    *   Corrected `.env` file loading logic in `tests/conftest.py` to load `llm_tester/.env` at the start of the test session.
    *   Refactored `llm_tester/llms/base.py` (`get_api_key`) to rely solely on the pre-loaded environment variables.
*   **Planning Documents:**
    *   Created `docs/future_planning/OPENROUTER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: Outlines steps for provider implementation and planned CLI features.
    *   Created `docs/future_planning/OPENROUTER_DYNAMIC_MODELS_PLAN.md`: Details the plan for dynamically fetching model info from the OpenRouter API.

## 4. Next Steps / Remaining Work

*   **Populate OpenRouter Config:** Add more desired models to `llm_tester/llms/openrouter/config.json` with their correct pricing and token limits.
*   **Implement Dynamic Model Loading:** Implement the logic described in `docs/future_planning/OPENROUTER_DYNAMIC_MODELS_PLAN.md` to fetch model details from the OpenRouter API, likely by modifying `llm_tester/llms/provider_factory.py`.
*   **Implement CLI Features:** Implement the CLI commands detailed in Section 6 of `docs/future_planning/OPENROUTER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:
    *   API Key Management (`llm-tester configure keys`).
    *   Model Info Updates (`llm-tester update-models`).
    *   Provider Enable/Disable (`llm-tester providers ...`).
    *   Model Enable/Disable (`llm-tester models ...`).
    *   LLM-Assisted Model Recommendation (`llm-tester recommend-model`).
*   **Add Integration Test Models:** Ensure the cheap/fast models defined in `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODELS` within `tests/test_provider_integration.py` exist in the respective provider `config.json` files (e.g., add `gemini-1.0-pro` to `google/config.json`, `mistral-tiny` to `mistral/config.json` if not present).
*   **Update Documentation:** Update the main `README.md` and any relevant guides in `docs/` to reflect the addition of the OpenRouter provider and the new CLI features once implemented.

## 5. How to Run / Test

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   Run all tests: `./venv/bin/pytest`
    *   Run specific provider tests: `./venv/bin/pytest tests/test_openrouter_provider.py`
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   Ensure relevant API keys are in `llm_tester/.env`.
    *   Ensure test models are defined in provider configs.
    *   Run: `./venv/bin/pytest tests/test_provider_integration.py -v -s --run-integration`
*   **CLI:**
    *   Ensure relevant API keys are in `llm_tester/.env`.
    *   Run specific provider test: `./venv/bin/python -m llm_tester.cli --providers openrouter --models openrouter:google/gemini-pro-1.5 --output report.md`
    *   Run with debug logging: Add `-vv` flag (e.g., `./venv/bin/python -m llm_tester.cli -vv ...`)
