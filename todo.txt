# LLM Tester Implementation TODO List

## Core Functionality
1. Implement proper error handling for API calls to LLM providers
2. Add timeout handling for LLM requests
3. Implement caching mechanism for LLM responses to avoid redundant API calls
4. Create more sophisticated accuracy calculation algorithms (weighted fields, semantic similarity)
5. Add support for batch testing to improve performance
6. Implement parallel processing for multiple tests
7. Add more comprehensive model discovery with dynamic loading

## Prompt Optimization
1. Develop more advanced prompt optimization strategies
2. Add few-shot learning examples to prompts
3. Implement A/B testing for prompt variations
4. Create a prompt template system with variables
5. Add support for chain-of-thought prompting
6. Implement comparative evaluation between different prompt strategies

## Providers and Models
1. Add support for more LLM providers (Cohere, HuggingFace, etc.)
2. Add configuration for different models within the same provider
3. Implement model-specific optimization techniques
4. Add support for streaming responses
5. Implement cost tracking and estimation for API calls
6. Add proxy support for API calls

## Reporting
1. Create visual reports with charts and graphs
2. Add export options for reports (PDF, HTML, etc.)
3. Implement benchmarking against previous test runs
4. Add detailed error analysis in reports
5. Create interactive dashboard for exploring results
6. Implement leaderboards for comparing model performance

## Testing Framework
1. Add integration tests for the test runner
2. ✅ Create unit tests for all components (Improved in Phase 1 - Added tests for config and mock systems)
3. ✅ Add docstrings and improve code documentation (Improved in Phase 1)
4. Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
5. Add type hints throughout the codebase
6. Add more test case categories beyond job ads

## Usability and Documentation
1. Create detailed documentation with usage examples
2. Enhance command-line interface with more options
3. ✅ Add configuration file support (Completed in Phase 1 - Centralized configuration)
4. Improve logging system with configurable levels
5. Create Jupyter notebook examples
6. Add installation and setup guide
7. ✅ Create developer guide for extending the framework (Completed in Phase 1 - Added DEVELOPMENT.md)

## Advanced Features
1. Implement automatic test case generation from pydantic models
2. Add support for testing against multiple versions of a prompt
3. Create system for collaborative prompt improvement
4. Implement adaptive testing based on previous results
5. Add features for fine-tuning models based on test results
6. Create schema inference from example data
7. Add support for chained LLM calls and multi-step workflows

## Data Processing
1. Add support for additional input formats (PDF, HTML, etc.)
2. Implement preprocessing options for source text
3. Add text chunking for long documents
4. Create data augmentation for more robust testing
5. Implement data anonymization for sensitive information
6. Add support for image and multimodal inputs

3. Medical records information extraction
4. Resume/CV parsing
5. Academic paper metadata extraction
6. Financial report analysis
7. News article summarization
8. Social media sentiment analysis
