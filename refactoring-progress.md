# LLM Tester Refactoring Progress Report

## Overview

We've successfully implemented the foundation of the pluggable LLM system, centralizing provider-specific code and creating a more maintainable architecture. This report summarizes the work completed and the current state of the refactoring.

## Completed Changes

### 1. Enhanced LLM Registry

- Updated `llm_registry.py` to properly manage provider instances
- Added `reset_provider_cache()` for resetting the provider cache during testing
- Added `get_provider_info()` to retrieve detailed provider information

### 2. Mock Provider Implementation

- Created a complete `MockProvider` implementation in `llms/mock/`
- Added appropriate configuration in `llms/mock/config.json`
- Implemented response generation based on source content
- Added support for different mock models

### 3. Refactored Provider Manager

- Updated `ProviderManager` to use the pluggable LLM system
- Removed provider-specific code for OpenAI, Anthropic, and other providers
- Implemented proper delegation to provider instances
- Added fallback handling for mock providers

### 4. Configuration Updates

- Standardized configuration files for OpenAI and Anthropic
- Fixed model names to align with API expectations
- Updated token limits to prevent API errors
- Added system prompts to configurations

### 5. Bug Fixes

- Fixed several issues with the UsageData handling
- Added support for older versions of the Anthropic API
- Addressed issues with response_format parameters
- Fixed token count and cost calculation

### 6. Test Updates

- Refactored tests to work with the new architecture
- Created more precise mocking for provider instances
- Added tests for the registry functionality
- Fixed test expectations to align with new implementation

## Current Status

The core functionality is working and all tests are passing. The system now uses the pluggable LLM architecture for all provider interactions, which means:

1. Provider-specific code is centralized in appropriate provider classes
2. Adding new providers is much simpler
3. Configuration is more consistent
4. Testing is more straightforward

## Key Files Changed

- `llm_tester/llms/base.py` - Base provider implementation
- `llm_tester/llms/llm_registry.py` - Provider registry
- `llm_tester/llms/provider_factory.py` - Provider factory
- `llm_tester/llms/mock/provider.py` - New mock provider implementation
- `llm_tester/llms/openai/provider.py` - Updated OpenAI provider
- `llm_tester/llms/anthropic/provider.py` - Updated Anthropic provider
- `llm_tester/utils/provider_manager.py` - Refactored provider manager
- Multiple test files with updated tests

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Provider-specific code is now in one place
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to provider APIs only require updates in one location
3. **Enhanced Testability**: The system is more modular and easier to test
4. **Easier Extensions**: Adding new providers is now a matter of adding files in one directory
5. **Better Error Handling**: More consistent error handling across providers
