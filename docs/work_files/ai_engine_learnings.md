# AI Engine: Learnings and Transferable Functionalities

This document outlines functionalities and design approaches from the `ai_engine` project that could be transferred to our existing `llm_tester` project to enhance its capabilities and architecture.

## Key Transferable Components

### 1. Advanced Cost Tracking and Analysis

**Benefits:**
- The `ai_engine` project provides detailed token and cost tracking for each test run
- Separates input and output costs for more accurate financial analysis
- Maintains detailed cost metrics at both individual test and aggregate levels

**Implementation Opportunities:**
- Add token counting per request and response in `provider_manager.py`
- Implement cost calculation based on model-specific pricing from a configuration file
- Add cost summaries to reports with breakdowns by model, test case, and token type

### 2. Multi-Pass Testing and Statistical Analysis

**Benefits:**
- The `ai_engine` runs multiple test passes for the same prompt/model combination
- Calculates statistical metrics like average accuracy and standard deviation ("sway")
- Enables more reliable model comparison by reducing variance in results

**Implementation Opportunities:**
- Add a `num_passes` parameter to the test runner
- Implement statistical aggregation of results across multiple passes
- Include consistency metrics (standard deviation) in test reports

### 3. Comprehensive Model Configuration System

**Benefits:**
- The `models.json` approach provides a clean, centralized way to manage model configurations
- Includes detailed properties for each model (tokens, costs, capabilities)
- Enables sophisticated model selection based on multiple criteria

**Implementation Opportunities:**
- Create a models configuration JSON file for our project
- Add a ModelSelector class that can recommend models based on criteria like cost, quality
- Implement dynamic model loading based on configuration

### 4. Advanced Prompt and Model Optimization

**Benefits:**
- The `prompt_optimiser.py` uses LLMs themselves to improve both prompts and models
- Optimizes the Pydantic models alongside the prompts
- Stores optimized artifacts for future use

**Implementation Opportunities:**
- Enhance our existing `prompt_optimizer.py` to also suggest model improvements
- Add capability to analyze and refine Pydantic models for better extraction
- Add auto-documentation of optimization steps and rationales 

### 5. More Sophisticated Accuracy Comparison System

**Benefits:**
- The `comparator.py` uses customizable comparison strategies for different field types
- Handles special cases like date ranges, keyword presence, and fuzzy string matching
- Provides field-level details on comparison results

**Implementation Opportunities:**
- Implement the comparison strategy system for more nuanced validation
- Add special handling for dates, lists, and fuzzy text matching
- Enhance validation reporting with per-field insights

### 6. Structured Test Results Management

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation between detailed results and summary information
- Stores test reports in a well-organized directory structure by module
- Time-stamped test reports for historical comparison

**Implementation Opportunities:**
- Refactor our report generation to separate details from summaries
- Implement a consistent report storage structure by module and timestamp
- Add capability to compare results across test runs

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Provider Abstraction

**Benefits:**
- The `model_provider.py` uses a cleaner interface for model selection and initialization
- Centralizes model configuration in external files
- More extensible for adding new providers

**Implementation Opportunities:**
- Create a formal provider interface/abstract base class
- Implement provider-specific classes that adhere to this interface
- Add factory pattern for provider instantiation

### 2. Modular Test Organization

**Benefits:**
- The project organizes tests by module with dedicated subdirectories
- Each module has its own models, prompts, test data, and results
- Self-contained modules make extensions easier

**Implementation Opportunities:**
- Reorganize our test structure to be more modular
- Create a consistent pattern for module organization
- Implement clear discovery and loading mechanisms

### 3. Command Line Interface Improvements

**Benefits:**
- More granular control via command line arguments
- Support for different modes (optimization only, testing only)
- Better progress reporting and logging

**Implementation Opportunities:**
- Enhance our CLI with more flexible options
- Add separate modes for different operations
- Improve feedback during long-running operations

## Immediate Action Items

1. Implement the cost tracking and analysis system
2. Add multi-pass testing capability with statistical analysis
3. Create a JSON-based model configuration system
4. Enhance the comparison system with different matching strategies
5. Improve the test reporting structure with summaries and detailed reports

## Long-term Considerations

1. Full refactoring of the provider system for better abstraction
2. Implementation of advanced optimization for both prompts and models
3. Create a more sophisticated module discovery and management system
4. Add historical comparison capabilities between test runs
5. Implement a dashboard for visualizing test results

This analysis provides a roadmap for selectively incorporating the best features from the `ai_engine` project while maintaining compatibility with our existing `llm_tester` codebase.
