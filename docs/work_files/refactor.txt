# LLM Tester Incremental Refactoring Plan

This plan divides the refactoring work into incremental phases, each of which can be tested after implementation to ensure stability before moving to the next phase.

THESE ARE DONE:

## Phase 1: Foundational Improvements
Focus: Fix immediate code duplication and improve testability without changing core architecture

### 1.1 Configuration Management
- Centralize configuration loading in a single utility class
- Add validation for configuration values
- Add unit tests for configuration loading

### 1.2 Basic Test Structure Improvements
- Fix duplicate test running logic in llm_tester.py 
- Add more appropriate test mocks
- Improve unit test coverage for basic functionality

### 1.3 Clean Up Mock Response Handling
- Consolidate mock response logic into a single module
- Create standardized mock response format
- Add unit tests for mock response system

- Create prompt template system with variables
- Add prompt versioning support
- Add unit tests for prompt templates

### 5.2 Prompt Optimization
- Refactor prompt optimization to reduce duplication
- Implement multiple optimization strategies
- Add unit tests for prompt optimization

## Phase 6: Error Handling and Reporting
Focus: Improve error handling and reporting capabilities

### 6.1 Error Handling Framework
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add categorization of errors
- Add unit tests for error handling

### 6.2 Reporting System
- Refactor report generation
- Add support for multiple output formats
- Add unit tests for reporting

## Phase 7: Performance Improvements
Focus: Improve performance without changing external interfaces

### 7.1 Request Batching
- Implement request batching for compatible providers
- Add response caching
- Add unit tests for batching

### 7.2 Parallel Execution
- Add support for parallel test execution
- Implement proper resource management
- Add unit tests for parallel execution

## Phase 8: CLI Improvements
Focus: Improve command-line interface while maintaining backward compatibility

### 8.1 Command Pattern Implementation
- Refactor CLI to use command pattern
- Separate UI logic from business logic
- Add unit tests for CLI commands

### 8.2 Interactive Mode Improvements
- Enhance interactive mode with better UX
- Add rich terminal output
- Update CLI tests

## Phase 9: Documentation and Testing
Focus: Improve documentation and test coverage

### 9.1 Code Documentation
- Add comprehensive inline documentation
- Update README and usage guides
- Create auto-generated API documentation

### 9.2 Test Coverage
- Increase unit test coverage to at least 80%
- Add integration tests
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for testing

## Phase 10: Packaging and Final Improvements
Focus: Final polishing and packaging improvements

### 10.1 Package Structure
- Reorganize package structure
- Improve dependency management
- Add installation verification

### 10.2 Plugin System
- Implement plugin system for extensions
- Create plugin discovery mechanism
- Add plugin management utilities

## Testing Strategy

After each phase:
1. Run all existing unit tests to ensure no regression
2. Run specific unit tests for new functionality
3. Manually test key user workflows
4. Check for performance impacts

Test output will be logged to a testing_output.log file that contains:
- Test pass/fail status
- Timing information
- Coverage statistics
- Any errors or warnings

This file can be analyzed between phases to identify any issues introduced during refactoring.
