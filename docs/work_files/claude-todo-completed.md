# Refactoring Completed

## Implemented Changes

1. Refactored the structure:
   - Test cases are now under specific model directories
   - Expected results & prompts are now alongside their models
   - Module-specific reports are now supported for each module
   - Implemented full module discovery with self-contained module logic

## Directory Structure Changes

- Each model is now self-contained in `/llm_tester/models/{model_name}/`
  - `model.py` - Contains the model definition
  - `tests/` - Contains test cases for this model
    - `sources/` - Contains source text files
    - `prompts/` - Contains prompt templates
    - `expected/` - Contains expected JSON outputs
    - `prompts/optimized/` - Contains optimized prompts
  - `reports/` - Contains module-specific reports

## Model Class Enhancements

Each model class now includes:
- Module configuration (MODULE_NAME, TEST_DIR, REPORT_DIR)
- A `get_test_cases()` class method that discovers test cases
- A `save_module_report()` class method that generates reports
- A `save_module_cost_report()` class method that generates cost reports

## Main Class Enhancements

The LLMTester class now:
- Uses module_discovery to locate and load modules
- Supports module-specific reports
- Returns dictionaries of report paths or report text
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy test structure

## Added ModuleDiscovery Utility

Created a utility class for module discovery:
- Searches the models directory for modules
- Supports various naming patterns for model classes
- Provides module information and test cases

## Additional Updates

- Updated README.md with new documentation about module structure
- Added module-specific README.md files to each model directory
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing code
