# Design Principles

This document outlines the core design principles behind the LLM Tester framework.

## Modularity and Extensibility

LLM Tester is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new components:

1. **Provider Pluggability**: New LLM providers can be added without modifying existing code
2. **Model Extensibility**: New extraction models can be added independently
3. **Component Isolation**: Components communicate through well-defined interfaces

## Clean Separation of Concerns

The framework maintains clean separation between different components:

1. **Provider System**: Handles communication with LLM APIs
2. **Model System**: Defines extraction schemas and validation
3. **Runner System**: Manages user interaction and test configuration
4. **Utility Modules**: Provide supporting functionality

## Consistent Interfaces

All components follow consistent interfaces:

1. **Providers**: All providers implement the `BaseLLM` interface
2. **Models**: All models extend `pydantic.BaseModel` and implement required methods
3. **Configuration**: Configuration follows a consistent JSON structure

## Configuration Over Coding

Behavior can be configured without changing code:

1. **Provider Configuration**: Providers are configured through JSON files
2. **Test Settings**: Test behavior is configured through a global configuration file
3. **Command-Line Options**: Many behaviors can be controlled through command-line arguments

## Testing and Validation

The framework emphasizes testing and validation:

1. **Model Validation**: Responses are validated against Pydantic schemas
2. **Accuracy Calculation**: Calculated through detailed field-by-field comparison
3. **Mock Providers**: Allow testing without real API calls

## Cost Awareness

LLM Tester is designed to be cost-conscious:

1. **Token Tracking**: Records token usage for all API calls
2. **Cost Calculation**: Calculates costs based on provider pricing
3. **Cost Reports**: Generates detailed cost reports for analysis

## User Experience

The framework prioritizes user experience:

1. **Multiple Interfaces**: Supports both command-line and interactive modes
2. **Clear Feedback**: Provides clear progress and error messages
3. **Comprehensive Reports**: Generates readable reports for analysis

## Abstraction Layers

LLM Tester provides different abstraction layers:

1. **Native Provider Integration**: Direct communication with provider APIs
2. **PydanticAI Integration**: Using PydanticAI as an abstraction layer
3. **Mock Providers**: Simulated responses for testing

## Error Handling

Robust error handling is a priority:

1. **API Error Handling**: Handles API errors gracefully
2. **Validation Errors**: Provides detailed validation error messages
3. **Configuration Validation**: Validates configuration before use

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is maintained:

1. **Code Documentation**: Documentation in code for developers
2. **User Guides**: Guides for framework users
3. **Reference Documentation**: Detailed reference information

## Performance and Scalability

The framework is designed for performance and scalability:

1. **Parallel Processing**: Supports parallel test execution where possible
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Minimizes memory usage for large tests
3. **Resource Management**: Efficiently manages connections and resources
